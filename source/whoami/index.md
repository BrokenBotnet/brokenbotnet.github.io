Version: v1.3.3.7

Welcome to Br🤖ken B🤖tnet. This page is a good starting point to learn more about me and my work. While I’m not actively writing blogs at the moment, this site still serves as a hub for what I’ve explored in the past: InfoSec, privacy, hacking techniques, OSINT, security news, CVEs, and vulnerabilities. My aim has always been to make complex security concepts accessible and understandable.

A bit about me: I go by rE-Bo0t.bx1 (or r3bo0tbx1). I’m an independent security researcher with a deep passion for Linux (I use Arch btw), open-source, security, and privacy. My career began in software development, where I worked with various web technologies and mobile app development. Over time, I shifted my focus to InfoSec, particularly penetration testing and security research, driven by a desire to apply my skills in a more impactful way.

These days, my routine revolves around InfoSec—delving into security topics, coding, reading, and, naturally, enjoying my coffee. When I’m not doing that, I participate in bug bounties, feeding stray cats and dogs, conduct freelance security research, and refine my skills in reverse engineering and web application security. I also frequently take on CTFs and reverse engineering.

Speaking of challenges, there was this one time when a minor vulnerability in a widely-used platform caught my eye. It was nothing major at first glance, just a tiny crack in the protective shield. But as I started digging deeper, I realized this was an entry point to something much larger. After a few sleepless nights, countless lines of code, and some caffeine-fuelled determination, I managed to exploit the vulnerability in a controlled environment. The experience reminded me why I love this field—it’s not just about finding flaws, but understanding the systems deeply enough to see what others might miss. And, of course, responsibly disclosing the findings to ensure the issue was patched before it could be exploited in the wild as 0day.

Although I’m not currently updating the blog, I’m still open to sharing knowledge. If there’s a topic you’re curious about, feel free to reach out, and I might consider it for future content.
